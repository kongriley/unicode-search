# unicode-search

> Use semantic search to find Unicode characters by describing them

## Setup and run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
On first run, `unicode-search` will take a few minutes to build the vector database.

## Todo
- [ ] Port to something faster (Rust, C++ etc)
- [ ] Graphical search
- [ ] Port to application / Raycast
